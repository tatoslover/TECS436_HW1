## LESSON PLAN — 60 Minutes

### 0–5 min | Setup, Karakia & Expectations

*Wait for the class to settle before speaking.*

Greet the class: **"Kia ora koutou."** Briefly introduce yourself — name and one or two sentences about who you are.

*Lead into the karakia without a long preamble — starting it signals that focus is required.*

Invite students to join in if they know it, then lead the **E tū karakia** aloud:

> *Whakataka te hau ki te uru,*
> *Whakataka te hau ki te tonga.*
> *Kia mākinakina ki uta,*
> *Kia mātaratara ki tai.*
> *E hī ake ana te atākura.*
> *He tio, he huka, he hauhunga.*
> *Tīhei mauri ora!*

Share the whakataukī and connect it to today:
> **"Mā te huruhuru ka rere te manu"** — adorn the bird with feathers so it can fly. The knowledge you pick up today is one of those feathers — it'll protect you from being tricked.

Set expectations briefly (keep this under a minute):
1. Laptop and a good attitude
2. Listen when others speak
3. Stay on task — this stuff is genuinely useful

### 5–8 min | Prior Knowledge Discussion *(2–3 min)*

> This is the required prior knowledge check — ask questions, listen, don't teach yet.

*Display a real $20 note or point to the denomination grid on screen.*

Ask the class — take 3–4 responses per question, don't fill the silence too quickly:

- **"What NZ notes do you know? How many denominations are there?"**
- **"What's actually on a $20 note — can anyone describe it without looking?"**
- **"Has anyone ever looked closely at a note and noticed something unusual on it?"**
- **"If someone handed you a fake $50, do you think you'd notice?"**

*You're listening for what they already know about security features, colours, birds, and portraits. Use their answers to decide how much ground you need to cover in the presentation — if they're sharp, move faster.*

**Watch for:** Students who say they never use cash. Don't dismiss it — note it and come back to it (part-time jobs, receiving change, helping a grandparent).

---

### 8–20 min | Presentation — NZ Notes & Security Features *(10–12 min)*

*Now you teach. Transition by saying:*
**"Alright — so yesterday I came across this article from the police. Have a read."**

*Display the NZ Police article embedded in the lesson plan. Give students ~90 seconds to read it silently.*

Point out the key facts:
- Counterfeit $50 and $100 notes in circulation
- Penalties: up to **7 years** for possession, **10 years** for knowingly using one
- The RBNZ recommends the **Look–Feel–Tilt** test

*Transition to the LFT method. If you have real notes, pass them around now.*

Walk through each step — use the feature cards on the lesson plan as your visual:

**Look:**
- Holographic transparent window (bird silhouette, NZ map, denomination value)
- Each note has a unique dominant colour
- Puzzle number — front and back halves align when held to light

**Feel:**
- Raised (intaglio) ink — run your finger across "Reserve Bank of New Zealand Te Pūtea Matua"
- Strong, smooth polymer — not paper

**Tilt:**
- A rolling colour bar moves across the bird's silhouette
- The hologram window shifts and changes colour, revealing fine details

*Give students ~2 minutes with a buddy to examine a note using LFT. Set a visible timer.*

After 2 minutes, ask each pair to share **one thing** they noticed. Aim for 4–5 responses. Affirm and layer onto their observations rather than just moving on.

**Watch for:** Students who are genuinely surprised by features they've never noticed before — use that energy. "You've probably had hundreds of these in your hand and never spotted that!"

### 20–40 min | Investigation Activity

*Energy should go up here. This is the main activity.*

Split the class into **two competing groups**. Frame it as a race, but emphasise that collaboration within each group matters — one loud guesser won't win it.

**Say this to brief them:**
> "The Reserve Bank has found fake notes in circulation. You're trainee investigators. Examine each of the misprinted notes on screen, work out what's wrong with each one, fill in your worksheet — then send a nominee up to me to check your answers. First group to correctly identify all the errors wins."

*Distribute blank Note Investigator worksheets. Point to the evidence images on the lesson plan display.*

Students can use:
- The Look–Feel–Tilt reference on the lesson plan
- The note size and tactile reference image
- The RBNZ website for additional detail

**Your role during the activity:**
- Circulate — don't stand at the front
- Ask probing questions rather than giving answers: *"What should be there? How does this compare?"*
- When a nominee comes to check, verify against the answer sheet. If something's wrong, send them back with one hint — not the answer
- If a group is stuck, nudge them toward a specific feature to recheck, not a specific note

**Watch for:** Groups that rush and just guess — make them justify each error before you confirm it.

---

### 40–50 min | Group Report Back

*Bring the class back together.*

Go note by note — show each evidence image as you discuss it. Ask the group with the correct answer to **explain their reasoning**, not just state what's wrong.

*Use the answer sheet to confirm or correct. If both groups got something wrong, open it to the whole class rather than treating it as a failure.*

Good consolidation questions:
- *"Which error was the hardest to spot — and why do you think that is?"*
- *"If you were working a till at a dairy, would you have caught this?"*

---

### 50–58 min | Kahoot Quiz

*Open the Kahoot on your device and display the join code. Keep it light — this is consolidation, not a test.*

[Kahoot — NZ Currency Quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/new-zealand-currency/777755cb-840f-4d5a-9816-f3c7552154fd)

If Kahoot isn't working or time is short, run it as a verbal quick-fire round instead.

---

### 58–60 min | Reflection & Exit Ticket

*Bring the energy back down.*

**Ask aloud:**
> "One sentence — why do security features on money actually matter? What happens if they didn't exist?"

Take 2–3 responses. Land on the key idea: **trust in currency underpins the whole economy** — if anyone could print money, it becomes worthless.

*Collect worksheets as the exit ticket. A student's name on the sheet confirms participation.*

Close with a brief, genuine acknowledgement of what they did well.

---

## If You Have Extra Time

Drop in any of these from the lesson plan:

- **Accessibility activity** — sort notes by size without looking; discuss tactile features and why they exist
- **Coins discussion** — extend the investigation to NZ coins and their security features
- **King Charles III / $20 note** — two versions currently in circulation, both legal tender; why?
- **Digital currency** — what is a CBDC? What would NZ lose if cash disappeared entirely?

## Common Student Questions

| Question | Suggested response |
|---|---|
| "Is it illegal to *have* a fake note if you didn't know it was fake?" | The law distinguishes between possession and knowingly using one — 7 years vs 10 years. You'd still likely have it confiscated. Good reason to check! |
| "Why do we still bother with cash?" | Many people rely on it — elderly, unbanked, rural areas, power outages. It also can't be hacked or frozen. |
| "Who decides what goes on the notes?" | The Reserve Bank, in consultation with the government. People and birds are chosen to reflect NZ identity and values. |
| "Why is the $20 still Queen Elizabeth?" | The RBNZ is using existing stock before printing King Charles III notes — still several years away. |
