Intro 
Kia ora Koutou
My name is Sam and I am your teacher for this lesson
A little bit about me…

Set the intention by opening with Karakia

Please feel free to join in if you know this Karakia
E tu

Whakataka te hau ki te uru,
Whakataka te hau ki te tonga.
Kia mākinakina ki uta,
Kia mātaratara ki tai.
E hī ake ana te atākura.
He tio, he huka, he hauhunga.
Tīhei mauri ora!

This Karakia is used to calm the spirit, clear the mind, and focus energy at the beginning of a day or meeting. It metaphorically calls for the winds of negativity, conflict, or stress to cease, inviting a calm, productive, and clear environment for learning or work.

For this lesson I have the expectation that you will be ready to learn by
Having the correct equipment for class. Today that means you will need a laptop and a good attitude
Collaborating respectfully. Because you are year 9’s and are at highschool, I expect you to know how to listen to each other. 
I also want to encourage you to stay on task. This information is going to be helpful so you don’t end up being tricked by fake money. 

I also want to share a whakatauki with you today

“Mā te huruhuru ka rere te manu” This means to adorn the bird with feathers so it can fly. 

When it comes to money management, this whakataukī highlights the idea that, with the right resources and support, a person can achieve great things. It speaks to the importance of preparation, guidance, and equipping oneself with the necessary tools or knowledge to succeed.

Now as you know this class is Buisness Studies and today’s lesson we are going to learn about the best part of Buisness…  Money. 

Learning Intention
I want to teach you how to
 Identify key features of NZ notes and coins
 Explain how security features prevent counterfeiting
 Apply the Look–Feel–Tilt method to detect fake notes

Article
So yesterday I cam across this article released by the police. It discusses counterfits that are being release. 

Go through the article and discuss the questions. 

In the article they mentione the look feel tilt test. Have a think about what this might mean. Now I have some real notes here. I want you to look at them and talk with a buddy about some features on these notes that you notice. Don’t forget to look feel tilt and see what you can find.

Set a timer for 2 minutes. 
Get each peer to give one thing they noticed to share with the class.

Activity
Now your mission is to become a detective. Split the group into two. 

We will see which group is the fastest, the detectives, but I want to see collaboration. 

 I have some ‘misprinted’ notes here. Can you identify what is wrong with them using the Note investigator sheet and the accessibility size grading? You are allowed to visit these websites to help with your investigation. 
Once you think you have all the errors identified, send a nominee up to me to check. 

When you have completed this task, you can explore the rest of the RBNZ website. 
Your exit ticket is your name on your Note Investigator Sheet.
